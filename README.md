# Stars API -- another try
Thanks a ton to [HYG](http://www.astronexus.com/hyg) for collating all this data so nicely!

## Screenshot
Here's a map drawn using equatorial coordinates (right ascension and declination), with size of star based on its apparent brightness (Sirius is the largest one). Stars are gray if they have a proper name listed in the database. (If you look closely, you'll find Deneb colored black!)

## Next steps:
- [ ] Let user zoom (perhaps by a click and drag box)
- [ ] Add background images on hover
- [ ] Move time with forward/back buttons to rotate
- [ ] Let user input location (lat/long) and see their local sky (first just target center, then try to get rotation correct for the hour)
- [ ] Going along with the above, add in Directions (N, S, E, W)
- [ ] Let user click and drag to move position of center (this of course depends on figuring out the coordinate mapping)
