# Stars API -- another try
Thanks a ton to [HYG](http://www.astronexus.com/hyg) for collating all this data so nicely!

Here's a map drawn using equatorial coordinates (right ascension and declination), with size of star based on its apparent brightness (Sirius is the largest one). Stars are gray if they have a proper name listed in the database. (If you look closely, you'll find Deneb colored black!)
